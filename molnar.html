                Systématiser is the diploma I presented at the ESADSE in June 2021, showing the results of an
                ongoing
                research project.

                The methodology of work is based on the one recommended by the CRAV (Centre de Recherche en Arts
                Visuels) created in 1960. Opposed to the idea of the "genius artist" producing artworks ex nihilo,
                the
                artists of CRAV suggested an artistic practice inspired by science, one that is based on a series of
                visual experimentations. <br>


                The starting points of Systématiser are the artworks of two artists who were part of the CRAV: the
                series Hommage à Dürer by Vera Molnár and Lumières alternées by Julio Le Parc.
                <br>
                In a process close to the one of reverse engineering, I reproduced the shapes of Molnár's artwork
                with
                Processing. Then I proceeded to a series of variations based on the graphic properties of the
                original
                artwork: the overlay of lines, dots contained in specific shapes, random distribution of coordinates
                ...


                As we move forward in the iterations, the experimentations drift from printed paper to a digital
                tool
                generating graphics. This tool included properties absent from the referenced work such as physical
                interactions, real time graphic alterations, a third dimension.

                The original desire of my project was to reveal the beauty that lies beneath the instructions or
                properties of the CRAV's referenced artworks. It is also an attempt at showing how artworks created
                today can be linked to and educate on the past history of digital art.
