                Systématiser is the diploma I presented at the ESADSE in June 2021, showing the results of an ongoing
                research project.

                The methodology of work is based on the one recommended by the CRAV (Centre de Recherche en Arts
                Visuels) created in 1960. Opposed to the idea of the "genius artist" producing artworks ex nihilo, the
                artists of CRAV suggested an artistic practice inspired by science, one that is based on a series of
                visual experimentations.
            </p><p>
                The starting points of Systématiser are the artworks of two artists who were part of the CRAV: the
                series Hommage à Dürer by Vera Molnár and Lumières alternées by Julio Le Parc.
            </p><p>

                The installation "Lumière alternées" was first reproduced in the video-game engine Unity. Free from the
                constraints of the real world, light is spread on theses new moving surfaces which are distorted in the
                virtual world through code.
            </p><p>

                The original desire of my project was to reveal the beauty that lies beneath the instructions or
                properties of the CRAV's referenced artworks. It is also an attempt at showing how artworks created
                today can be linked to and educate on the past history of digital art.
