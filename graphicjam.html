                This project was conceived within the framework Digital Tools for Creative Collaboration initiated
                by
                the ESADSE. While contemporary digital collaboration design often focuses on remote communication,
                Graphic Jam proposes to transform the computer back into a machine which physically brings people
                together. It transcribes the communication experience of local multiplayer video games into a
                graphic
                design context.
            </p><p>
                Developed with Processing, the graphic generator features a bitmap editor, a vector editor based on
                bezier curves and a font editor. This software must be simultaneously operated by two people using
                gamepads, as the graphic functions require cooperation and communication in order to unleash their
                full
                potential. The tactile approach leads to an instinctive workflow as well as happy accidents and
                therefore, interesting visuals results emerge swiftly straight from the first jam.
            </p><p>
                The code is available under a free licence on github.
